**Introduction:**
In this project, we analyzed datasets regarding greenhouse gas emissions from cities in 2016 and 2017. 
Our goal was to understand trends and identify potential correlations between variables such as population, GDP, and temperature. We applied various data analysis and machine learning methods, including linear regression, multiple regression, polynomial regression, and clustering techniques like KMeans clustering.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** 
The datasets we used had a significant amount of missing data and varying data quality, so we had to clean and fill in the missing values. 
We used the mean for numerical values and the mode for categorical variables. This was an effective approach, but here is an area where improvements could have been made:

* Improvement Suggestion: Instead of simply using the mean or mode, we could have implemented more advanced techniques, such as KNN imputation or Expectation Maximization, which take into account the context of the missing data.

**Data Analysis:** 
We began with a basic analysis of the datasets. Here are some key points:

We explored the correlation between variables like population and total CO2 emissions, where we found a correlation of 0.73. This indicated that larger cities tend to have higher emissions, which makes sense.

Another correlation we discovered was between Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which were strongly related to each other (correlation of 0.98). This shows that direct and indirect emissions from cities are closely linked.

**Challenges in the Analysis:** 
While we identified some interesting correlations, there were also several challenges:

Categorical variable “C40”: We found a negative correlation between this variable and population, suggesting that cities in the C40 initiative generally have lower emissions per capita. However, this conclusion is somewhat limited due to missing data in our dataset.

* Improvement Suggestion: It would have been beneficial to include more cities participating in C40 to achieve a more accurate analysis. We could have searched for more comprehensive datasets or alternative sources.
Modeling:

**Linear Regression:** 

We started with a simple linear regression between population and total emissions. The model gave an R² value of 0.45, which means that about 45% of the variation in emissions could be explained by population size.

* Improvement Suggestion: We could have explored additional factors, such as energy consumption, transportation, or industrial activities, to improve the model’s accuracy.

**Multiple Regression:** 

We used both population and GDP as independent variables, but the model performed worse with an R² of 0.21. This suggests that GDP did not significantly contribute to explaining emissions.

* Improvement Suggestion: We could have added more variables, such as energy consumption or urbanization rate, to enhance the model’s performance.

**Polynomial Regression:** 

We applied polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships between population and emissions, which yielded an R² of 0.56. However, we identified signs of overfitting, suggesting that the model might be too complex and fitting noise rather than meaningful patterns.

* Improvement Suggestion: To avoid overfitting, we could have used cross-validation to better assess the model's ability to generalize.

**KMeans Clustering:**

* We used KMeans clustering to segment cities based on their emission data. The results showed that three clusters fit best, but the clusters were unequally sized, indicating that our choice of features might not have been optimal.

* Improvement Suggestion: We could have explored alternative features or methods like hierarchical clustering to improve the results.

**Conclusion:** 
Our analysis has provided insights into how population and GDP impact cities' greenhouse gas emissions, but the accuracy of our models has been limited. We identified areas where more comprehensive data and alternative modeling techniques could improve the results. If we were to repeat the project, we would focus on including more relevant factors and employing more advanced methods to handle missing data and prevent overfitting.
